# react_test

A modern web application built with React, showcasing a modular component structure suitable for various web projects such as marketing sites, landing pages, or informational portals. This project leverages the standard `create-react-app` setup for efficient development and build processes.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Component Architecture**: Utilizes a well-organized structure with reusable UI components like `Navbar`, `Article`, `Brand`, `CTA` (Call to Action), and `Feature` to promote maintainability and scalability.
*   **Standard React Setup**: Built upon `create-react-app`, providing a robust and pre-configured environment for rapid development, testing, and production deployment.
*   **Dynamic Iconography**: Integrates `react-icons`, offering easy access to a vast collection of popular SVG icons for enhanced user interface elements.
*   **Pre-configured Scripts**: Comes with standard scripts for starting a development server, building for production, and running tests.

## Tech Stack

*   **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used.
*   **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
*   **react-icons**: A library providing popular icon sets as React components.
*   **create-react-app**: A toolchain for setting up a modern React web application.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react_test.git
    cd react_test
    ```
    (Note: Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username if this project is hosted.)

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production to the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
